    <h1>Kid Tussles with Some Blonde Chick's Private Army</h1>
    <h2>The Beauty of Chaos</h2>
    <p>Throughout my life, all I ever wanted to do was draw and make stories. The One's that make people make faces at,
        the kind of faces that would be a result
        of something truely worth remembering. When It comes to my life upon every step I took I always had this thought
        in my head of I was going to achieve my dream.
        The dream of making humans, smile and laugh through an art form. And what that art form would be? Firstly I
        wanted to make a comic. Why Exactly a Comic?
