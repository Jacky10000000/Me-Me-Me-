    <h2>The Beauty of Chaos</h2>
    <p>Throughout my life, all I ever wanted to do was draw and make stories. The One's that make people make faces at,
        the kind of faces that would be a result
        of something truely worth remembering. When It comes to my life upon every step I took I always had this thought
        in my head of I was going to achieve my dream.
        The dream of making humans, smile and laugh through an art form. Specifically in making comics, I've slowley
        developed this story throughout the start of Highschool, first used as more of a pleasant escape from the
        harships of
        school, specifically in my math class. I have always struggled in any subject related any sort of mathematics
        and
        in stress I always
        Loved to draw as a sort of recreational distraction; back in the day it used to be just stick figures and they
        slowley became more complex including dynamic backgrounds
        and the abilities of what I can draw in general. This accumulated into wanting to express this story with first
        of course showcasing my artstyle.

        This is unfinished but my usually I consistently hand draw big eyes on my characters and animals with
        simple designs to the backgrounds
        with exagerated shading.

    <p>With that being said, I'd love to go over what inspired this entire project in the First Place.</p>

    <h2>Inspirations</h2>

    <p>This story was at it's conception from my very first day dream during freshman year, I didn't have any initial
        inspirations but I knew I wanted to draw more than just
        simple stickman. So I took it upon myself to try to draw a tall girl in a Fuchsia colored trench coat and long
        Dark Burgandy hair, as the first day dream was her
        pulling a sword out of stone in a timid and curious manner. However the drawing itself was definetly far from
        what she looked like in the dream, I wasn't very good at this time,
        and in terms of expression she was a lot more confident in the drawing than in the dream and I didn't know at
        the time but the contrast of the drawing and the dream, I accidentaly my first
        OC who'll consistently appear in my later doodles on assignments to actual drawings. And with that, I was
        starting to look for inspiration to expand and develop more reoccuring characters
        and settigns for my art which will eventually deelop into my desire to make a full feldge comic and universe
        into light. And I'll go into them right now.

    <h4>Falling Out of The World</h4>
    <p> Delatrune was a really big inspiration in terms of characters and story. I really liked the idea of someone just
        falling out of reality
        and into some different world completely foreign and strange and even hostile at times. I didn't know the name
        for such a genre at the time but
        it's called Isekai. In terms of world, at first I was fully committed to having a medeival high fantasy setting
        however I realized I only liked the environments
        and weapons, not really the magic or fashion and the themes of good versus evil. Reffering back to the first
        chracter I made in my head she was characterrized as impulsive, reckless, And
        agressive who's fighting style relied more on being angile and perceptive than sheer strength. Including her
        fashion being a trench coat, it just wouldn't work. So I decided to settle for a renaissance period at this
        point in time because I reeally liked guns
        and battles where each regiment carries really long pikes. It wasn't until later until I incoorpeated the
        1920-1940s setting which I'll get into in the next couple of inspirations. When it comes to the character
        inspirations
        I want to go more in depth in another section.</p>
