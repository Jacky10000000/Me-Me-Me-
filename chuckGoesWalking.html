    <h1>Kid Tussles with Some Blonde Chick's Private Army</h1>
    <h2>The Beauty of Chaos</h2>
    <p>Throughout my life, all I ever wanted to do was draw and make stories. The One's that make people make faces at,
        the kind of faces that would be a result
        of something truely worth remembering. When It comes to my life upon every step I took I always had this thought
        in my head of I was going to achieve my dream.
        The dream of making humans, smile and laugh through an art form. Specifically in making comics, I've slowley 
        developed this story throughout the start of Highschool, first used as more of a pleasant escape from the harships of
        school, specifically in my math class. I have always struggled in my classes related any sort of mathematics and in stress I always 
        Loved to draw, back in the day it used to be just stick figures
