    <h2>The Beauty of Chaos</h2>
    <p>Throughout my life, all I ever wanted to do was draw and make stories. The One's that make people make faces at,
        the kind of faces that would be a result
        of something truely worth remembering. When It comes to my life upon every step I took I always had this thought
        in my head of I was going to achieve my dream.
        The dream of making humans, smile and laugh through an art form. Specifically in making comics, I've slowley
        developed this story throughout the start of Highschool, first used as more of a pleasant escape from the
        harships of
        school, specifically in my math class. I have always struggled in any subject related any sort of mathematics
        and
        in stress I always
        Loved to draw as a sort of recreational distraction; back in the day it used to be just stick figures and they
        slowley became more complex including dynamic backgrounds
        and the abilities of what I can draw in general. This accumulated into wanting to express this story with first
        of course showcasing my artstyle.

        This is unfinished but my usually I consistently hand draw big eyes on my characters and animals with
        simple designs to the backgrounds
        with exagerated shading.

    <p>With that being said, I'd love to go over what inspired this entire project in the First Place.</p>
