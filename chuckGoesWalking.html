        <h2>The Beauty of Chaos</h2>
        <p>Throughout my life, all I ever wanted to do was draw and make stories. The One's that make people make faces
            at,
            the kind of faces that would be a result
            of something truely worth remembering. When It comes to my life upon every step I took I always had this
            thought
            in my head of I was going to achieve my dream.
            The dream of making humans, smile and laugh through an art form. Specifically in making comics, I've slowley
            developed this story throughout the start of Highschool, first used as more of a pleasant escape from the
            harships of
            school, specifically in my math class. I have always struggled in any subject related any sort of
            mathematics
            and
            in stress I always
            Loved to draw as a sort of recreational distraction; back in the day it used to be just stick figures and
            they
            slowley became more complex including dynamic backgrounds
            and the abilities of what I can draw in general. This accumulated into wanting to express this story with
            first
            of course showcasing my artstyle.

            This is unfinished but my usually I consistently hand draw big eyes on my characters and animals with
            simple designs to the backgrounds
            with exagerated shading.

        <p>With that being said, I'd love to go over what inspired this entire project in the First Place. Or you can

         INSPIRATIONS

    <section id="inspirationsSection" class="Inspirations hidden chaos jacques-francois-regular">
        <h2>Inspirations</h2>

        <p>This story was at it's conception from my very first day dream during freshman year, I didn't have any
            initial
            inspirations but I knew I wanted to draw more than just
            simple stickman. So I took it upon myself to try to draw a tall girl in a Fuchsia colored trench coat and
            long
            Dark Burgandy hair, as the first day dream was her
            pulling a sword out of stone in a timid and curious manner. However the drawing itself was definetly far
            from
            what she looked like in the dream, I wasn't very good at this time,
            and in terms of expression she was a lot more confident in the drawing than in the dream and I didn't know
            at
            the time but the contrast of the drawing and the dream, I accidentaly my first
            OC who'll consistently appear in my later doodles on assignments to actual drawings. And with that, I was
            starting to look for inspiration to expand and develop more reoccuring characters
            and settigns for my art which will eventually deelop into my desire to make a full feldge comic and universe
            into light. And I'll go into them right now.

        <h3>Deltarune</h3>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="suitTie/flat,750x,075,f-pad,750x1000,f8f8f8.jpg" alt="What?">
        <h4>Falling Out of The World</h4>
        <p> Delatrune was a really big inspiration in terms of characters and story. I really liked the idea of someone
            just
            falling out of reality
            and into some different world completely foreign and strange and even hostile at times. I didn't know the
            name
            for such a genre at the time but
            it's called Isekai. In terms of world, at first I was fully committed to having a medeival high fantasy
            setting
            however I realized I only liked the environments
            and weapons, not really the magic or fashion and the themes of good versus evil. Reffering back to the first
            chracter I made in my head she was characterrized as impulsive, reckless, And
            agressive who's fighting style relied more on being angile and perceptive than sheer strength. Including her
            fashion being a trench coat, it just wouldn't work. So I decided to settle for a renaissance period at this
            point in time because I reeally liked guns
            and battles where each regiment carries really long pikes. It wasn't until later until I incoorpeated the
            19th Century setting which I'll get into in the next couple of inspirations. When it comes to the character
            designs.</p>


        <p>When it came to the inspiration for my the characters, Deltarune was a foundation starting point for
            how I wanted to characterize them, from the noble and stoic to the impulsive and crass and the soft and
            temperate. It was light hearted and wasn't dark or edgy, this game presented me the very first aspect of my
            story that I rally wanted to communicate
            was the benefit of cooperation and friendship and being kind in general. It was definetly a start, but my
            characters and story was reflection
            of how I saw the world and dynamics of how people acted between eachother, so I had to day dream elsewhere
            in terms of character.

        <h3>L.A. Noire</h3>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="suitTie/d3jehc7-dae87a6c-6248-4474-a2e9-cf060a741f2d.jpg" alt="What?">
        <h4>Keen eyes and Fine Fashion</h4>

        <p>Beofre I started to even expand my drawingskills I was always enamored with the entire setting of L.A. Noire.
            It
            was the first video game
            where I was attracted to 1940s fashion including veihcles, they just looked so nice including the
            architecture,
            the sound the dress shoes made upon the floor. On my second playthrough of the game when I was much older
            I really liked the plot as I was able to maturely understand it, from big crimes like Drug Rings, Organized
            Crime, Corruption,
            Murder, to the more
            low scale ones like Arson, and Traffic which later influenced what my stories plot was all about along with
            the Isekai plot point. I loved how the game itself emphasises you to be as perceptive as
            possible from human expression in interviews
            and interrigations, including finding clues in many specifica areas high and low. And lastly, the music, I
            really loved Jazz
            once I started this game out, it sounded good to me, not sure why, but it sounded classy.
        </p>

        <p>I started incorperating aspects of this games setting as it fit a lot more for what I had fashioned my
            characters with including me really wanting
            to draw big large scale cities. Lastly was also the fact that I really enjoyed the weapons even thought
            combat isn't really this games strong suit, the wooden stocked guns of WW2 really attracted me, even back
            when I was really small and my Father introduced me to Call of Duty Black Ops, specifcally in the missions
            where WW2 was still in progress. At this point I dropped the
            Renaisance setting entirely and took on the embracement the Early to Mid 20th century, it wasn't until I
            played Mafia
            II where I actually
            figured out the Weapons and clothing and style.</p>



        <h3>Batman: The Animated Series</h3>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="suitTie/da3v72i-24a26e15-5d0a-4dd7-9688-acf5ac316dd0.png" alt="What?">
        <h4>Darkness and High Tower's</h4>

        <p> If L.A. Noire was my starting point in how I wanted my setting to truely be realized. When I watched
            this show and it's dark aestetics mixxed in with it's pops of bright yellow lights I was immediately in awe,
            including the sharp blocky character desings.
            I actually found the name for it, Dark Deco, Which is a sort of sub architectural style of Art Deco which is
            actually based on the 1920s. This was also when I was inspired by Batman himself in the show, Incredibly
            smart, Perceptive, and Strong, and intimidating,
            He would inspire all three of my main characters strong suits which I will present to you in The Characters
            section. Overall this animated show was the first to truely engross me in what a
            dark art style really meant, and I was absolutely down to Incorperate it once I started getting a hand of
            shading.
        </p>

        <p>
            When it came to the villains this singular vigilante has faced, I was really interested into the psycology
            of why these characters do
            The things they do, ranging from deep trauma, Split Personality disorders, ASPD and BPD, or they just do
            what they do for the sake of it. Really did inspire me to really try to
            Implement these character traits to my antagonists and protagonists to really muddy the water's in terms of
            morals.However this was only really a part of a foundation for what role my character's ethicaly and
            philosophically play in
            my story.

        <h3>Mafia II</h3>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="suitTie/mafia_2_by_shrimpy99_d94wk3q-fullview.jpg" alt="What?">
        <h4>Green Is all I See</h4>
        <p>Mafia II was more of an expansion to what I wanted in terms of setting, and was the only game to introduce me
            to the 1950s. Other than he fashion the cars were
            a bit different compared to the ones in L.A. Noire, being noticably faster and definetly a lot more stylish
            and colorful. When it came to the plot itself,
            I was always split in how I should represent what my cast of derranged fools should be, Organized
            Criminals?, Low life Thugs?, Noble Vigilante's?, Anti Heroes? Now Mafia II didn't provide
            me an answer but it difently gave me a piece of it, mostly of course centered aorund the crime aspect of
            things, grand theft auto, murder, robbery, larceny, brawling, betrayal, deceit, and general paranoia all
            around; Mafia II
            gave me insight in how I could properly make my cast of rogue's really be faced with internal and external
            struggle and making my story
            feel genuinely at times hopeless and tense. Including playing into how deep a person could go down in terms
            of greed and arrogance, putting many in danger.
        </p>

        <p>I definetly enjoyed the action, although simple. Was a step up from L.A. Noire. It gave me a little bit more
            insight in the functionality
            of the weapons including the stances and fast paced combat encounters.

        <h3>Lupin The III: Castle of Cagliostro</h3>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="suitTie/lupin_the_third__car_chase__fan_art__by_inhus_dgdhqhv-fullview.jpg" alt="What?">
        <h4>Noble Tomfloolery and Saving Well Dressed Women</h4>
        <p>From the cynical nihilism and overall moral ambiguity in Mafia II, Lupin the III: Castle of Cagliostro was
            the movie that provided me something that really fell more in line in what my character's actions and
            motive's were to be.
            I was always really attracted in how entertainment can be fun for the sake of it. The characters felt really
            larger than life from the
            detail's of what color their muzzle flash was to their incredibly cartoonish skill from espoinage to general
            violence. There was also themes
            of how less then virtuous can change for the better from a psoitive influene in their lives, which was a
            theme I really wanted to bring about in
            my story as the main protagonist gets into many confrontations with quite excentric character's throughout
            his journey. As for the Morally grey
            aspect I wanted to show in my story, I was always intending to add people who were objectively evil and also
            those who were objectively good.
            Withwhat themes and tone I wanted to implement in my story, with all of this to work with I had to really
            balance this out to not make the pacing
            jarring or confusing. I'm still practicing currently.

            alt="What?">
        <h4>Through The Fields and Trees, Through The Rails and Towns, I'm Still Marching</h4>
        <p>This was a game that really did inspire the whole arsenal of weapons many would be using in my world including giving me a clearer
            insight into how I could make more stealthy and espoinage type of arcs instead of just full blown explosive action. The music itself
            was classical, composed by Michael Giacchino
