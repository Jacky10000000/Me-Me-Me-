    <h1>Big War Game Over Some Water! Gone Sour!</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>What Exactly is This?</h2>
        <p>When I was playing Tower Defense Simulator in Roblox I was thinking to myself, yeah I can make something like
            this all by myself, and I also really . But I had to
            to make it stand out from the crowd, so I settled with the first question when it came to the gameplay
            Concept. Why are you defending in the first place?
        </p>


        <h3>When The World Has No Room For Flowers</h3>
        <p>When it came to this game I thought it'd be a cool idea to make it based around a post apocalyptic holocaust
            where new civilizations are being founded around
            and are expanding. Specifically you play in the perspective of a singular City State, known for their
            sufficient water plants.
            Caught in the crossfire of a Great War between 5 Factions who's goal is to flank around into your City to
            get the jump on their opposition, completely uncaring to the insurmountiful destruction they'll 'cause as
            they enter the city stat'es region.
            I thought this was a pretty good set up for my type tower defense as it plays into the entire aestetic and
            gameplay of the game, which I 'll get into.
        </p>

        <h3>The Defense Phase</h3>
        <p>Upon the Start of the Game you'll be put straight into the action, they'll be a period of time where you can
            set up defenses and place your
            troops wherever you like. New players only get the Rifleman squad that have three rifleman and a singular
            Officer but I'm intending to make
            any game last long with even the "weakest" Untit, ultimately depending on your strategic skill than your
            quality of Troop</p>

        <figcaption>Example of what a proper defense would look like. The Units Featured are Rifleman and the Support
            with Sapper Constructions</figcaption>



        <h3>The Assault Phase</h3>
        <p>Usually if the Enemy Wave has lost too many of their troops or if you were able to destroy there morale
            they'll stop into a standstill.
            This would be the perfect oppurtunity for you to launch a counter attack, picking off as many incoming
            reinforcement's
            as you can so the next wave will be less severe or even force the main line to pull out completely. Now as
            the Rifleman Unit works better as more of
            a defense Unit unless you have a wide number of them to large a full on charge, it'd be better to get Units
            more suited to fight up close.
        </p>

        <h4>Spec Ops Units</h4>
        <p>These Units were made specifically for certain defensive and offensive purposes Rifleman can't achieve. Such
            as Armored Units, Chemical Attacks
            Snipers, Paratrooper Raids, and Bombardments. Commando are perfect for operations that involve Chemical
            warfare and Urban Close to Mid Quarters
            Operations, best used for flanking and sabotaging of special enemy Units.

        <p>There is also anti-armor units that can be used to explode any incoming vehicle that seeks to bust through
            sapper defenses or buildings.</p>

        <h3>Enemy Behaviors</h3>

        <p>With how strategically demanding this game will get once we reach later waves, it makes sense that the A.I.
            should give the player a run for their
            money. They'll always try to flank your defenses, never wanting to use the main roads unless armored
            vehicles are present. They'll utilize granades,
            provide surpressing fire for comrades falling back. They'll take buildings and dig in to safely set up
            artillery barrages up close. And yes, they can also
            Surrender. By all means I want the A.I. to always try to one up the player even in desperate circumstances
            to where sometimes they'll use suicidal
            tactics.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project is very much in it's early stages as I haven't gotten into scripting nor have I finished the
            first map.
            I have been extremely busy with school so I will definetly get to work on this by summer break. For what
            it's worth I am
            really exited for when this project is finished with all of the complete models and maps including units!
